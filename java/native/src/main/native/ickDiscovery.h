    /* These are the main commands to communicate to the P2P Core for player/controller communication.
     Service communication would be somewhat similar but uses different protocols.
     The main difference will probably be that a service has an address/service prefix where a player/controller has a UUID.

     Currently, there is NO protocol handling whatsoever in this, all protocol components have to be embedded in the JSON message(s) being sent, this includes request IDs.

     General Syntax:
     return value:
     0 - success;
     negative values: errors
     TBD: meaningful error values and an error details retrieval system, currently, only -1 is being returned on any error.
     TBD: define a results enum to cpature this.

     char * UUID:       the unique identifier of the device you want to communicate with. For services this would be the service prefix.
     void * message:    the message to be sent in raw, encoded format (that is: a valid, encoded JSON/RPC command.
                        TBD: If we want to allow bundling of several commands in an array, we need to define that on the application layer level; here, the encoded array would be supplied
     size_t size:       the size (in bytes) of the encoded message. Must nox exceed 64KB. TBD: Is this enough? I assume 16 bit size parameters in the protocol, causing this limitation. We probably don't want chunks that are all too big.

     TBD: Define whether to also support synchronous calls that wait for a reply.
     TODO: Currently there is no way to de-register callbacks other than to stop the whole ickDiscovery
